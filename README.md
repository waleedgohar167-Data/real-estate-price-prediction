-Real Estate Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting real estate property prices based on key features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total area (square footage). Using machine learning, the model helps estimate a property’s market value with data-driven accuracy — a valuable tool for investors, realtors, and buyers.

- Objective

To develop a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various property attributes.

-Dataset

The dataset used contains information on:

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

Property size (in square feet)

Price

Data preprocessing included:

Handling missing values

Feature scaling

Outlier detection and removal

(Dataset not uploaded due to size constraints.)

 -Model Building

The following steps were performed:

Data Cleaning & Exploration – Identified correlations and visualized distributions.

Feature Engineering – Selected key variables contributing most to price.

Model Training – Trained regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).

Model Evaluation – Used metrics like R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess performance.

 -Results

The final model achieved an R² score of 0.85, indicating strong predictive capability.

Accurately predicts property prices based on given inputs (bedrooms, bathrooms, size).

 -Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Streamlit (for web app interface)

- Outcome

A fully functional Streamlit web app that allows users to input property details and instantly receive a predicted price.
